This crate implements the [PMTiles v3 spec](https://github.com/protomaps/PMTiles/blob/master/spec/v3/spec.md),
originally created by Brandon Liu for Protomaps.

**THIS CRATE IS NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE!** However, you might be able to use it for a demo project.

## Features

- Opening and validating PMTile archives
- Querying tiles
- Backends supported:
  - Async `mmap` (Tokio) for local files
  - Async `http` and `https` (Reqwuest + Tokio) for URLs

## Plans & TODOs

- [ ] Documentation and example code
- [ ] Support writing and conversion to and from MBTiles + `x/y/z`
- [ ] Support additional backends (sync `mmap` and `http` at least)
- [ ] Support additional async styles (e.g., `async-std`)

PRs welcome!
